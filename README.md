# Variables
- Are containers for stroring data values.
- Type a if a variable names begins with number.

*EXAMPLES OF VARIABLES:-*
- x = 5
- y = "Anati"


# Data Structures
- Are containers for different kinds of data. 
- Allows for the storage of a list of values in a single variable.

# Operators
- They are used to manipulate and perform on data.
- Most familiar type of operator is the arithmentic operator, which is used for mathematical calucation.

TO Concastinate a string in python - you must you '+' operator to add strings together for example '2' + '222' = 2222

# Control Flow
They use If/Else, for loop and while loop statement to control flow in programming. Also allows you to execute a block of code only if a certain condition is met.
- while loop - repeatedly executes a block of code until the condition is satisfied. *For example it check if count is less than or equal to 5*.
- for loop -  is used to repeatedly execute a group of statements as long as the condition is satisfied. *For example used to iterate over a sequence*
- If/Else -  used to execute both the true part and the false part of a given condition. 

# Functions
Is like a machine that  takes inputs and produces outputs. It can be defined using *def* keyword follwed by the function name and arguments in paranthesis.

# Classes and Objects
when you have this error *TypeError:Object() take no arguments*. This error is raised when you do not declare method called __init__ in a class that accepts arguments.


# Ints & Floats
given:  round(14/3,2) comma 2 means the how many numbers must be after the comma.

*Factorial Challenge*
Given 5!
Solution 
5! = 5*4*3*2*1 =120
factorial are only defined for positive integers(including 0). When its a negative integers or 1,2(number with comma) words it will return None.

# Alternative number Types
Example:
Int(‘100’)		  	int(‘100’,2)
= 100				      =4
 
Int(‘101’,2)		                        		int(‘333’,4)		                              		int(‘1ab’,16)
=1*(2**2) + 0*(2**1) + 1*(2**0)            	=3*(4**2) + 3(4**1) + 3*(4**0)	                	=1*(16**2) + 10*(16**1) +11*(16**1)
=(1*4) + (0*2) + (1*1)			                =(3*16) + (3*4) + (3*1)		                       	= (1*256) + (10*16) + (11*1)
= 4+0+1			                              	= 48+12+3			                                   	= 256 + 160 + 11
=5				                                	=63                                               = 427
